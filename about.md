Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Red Five standing by. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. You mean it controls your actions? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

As you wish. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

What!? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
