  text: <p><br>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Army had half a day.
    Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Not tricks, Michael, illusions.
    I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Marry me. There's only one man I've ever called
    a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television
    actor. I hear the jury's still out on science. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging
    you.</p><p>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll
    have more fun. Army had half a day. Michael! Michael! He'll want to use your yacht,
    and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I'm a monster. Oh, you're gonna
    be in a coma, all right. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.
    That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'</p>
