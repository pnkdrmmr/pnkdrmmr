  text: <p><br>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Army had half a day.
    Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Not tricks, Michael, illusions.
    I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Marry me. There's only one man I've ever called
    a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television
    actor. I hear the jury's still out on science. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging
    you.</p><p>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll
    have more fun. Army had half a day. Michael! Michael! He'll want to use your yacht,
    and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I'm a monster. Oh, you're gonna
    be in a coma, all right. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.
    That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'</p>

  text: "<p>Steve Holt! I've opened a door here that I regret. We just call it a sausage.
    There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Really? Did nothing cancel?</p><p>Now,
    when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Now,
    when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. No,
    I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's
    questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p><p>That's why
    you always leave a note! But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean
    anything anymore? That's why you always leave a note! There's only one man I've
    ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you
    is a television actor.</p><p>Whoa, this guy's straight? No! I was ashamed to be
    SEEN with you. I like being with you. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't
    that mean anything anymore? Michael!</p>"
